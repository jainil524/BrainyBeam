# üìÅ Image Upload with Progress & Alert System

## Tags
- **React**
- **Image Upload**
- **File Preview**
- **Progress Bar**
- **Alerts**
- **Drag and Drop**
- **Simulated File Upload**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **React Dropzone**

## Language
- **JavaScript**
- **React.js**
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**

This project is a **React-based** image upload application that provides a user-friendly interface for dragging and dropping multiple images, tracking upload progress, and showing notifications for successful or failed uploads. The project also handles file size formatting and supports previewing images before uploading them.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Supports dragging images into the dropzone or selecting files manually.
- **File Preview**: Displays thumbnails of the images before uploading.
- **Progress Bar**: Tracks the upload progress of each file.
- **Alerts**: Displays error or success messages during the upload process.
- **File Size Formatting**: Dynamically formats and displays file size (in Bytes, KB, MB, etc.).
- **File Removal**: Allows users to remove files from the upload list before or after upload.
- **Simulated Upload Process**: Uses a simulated upload function to mock the file upload process.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based library for building the user interface.
- **React Dropzone**: Handles drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Lucide Icons**: Used for icons (upload, delete, success, and error).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the components and layout.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-upload-progress-alert.git
cd image-upload-progress-alert
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash

## ‚öôÔ∏è Component Overview

### 1. **Alert Component**
Displays notifications based on the type of error or success message. This is designed to inform users about upload status.

```js
const Alert = React.forwardRef(({ className, variant, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
        <div
            ref={ref}
            role="alert"
            className={`rounded-lg border p-4 ${variant === 'destructive'
                ? 'border-red-500 bg-red-50 text-red-700'
                : 'border-gray-200 bg-white text-gray-900'
                } ${className}`}
            {...props}
        />
    );
});
```

### 2. **Progress Bar Component**
Visually displays the upload progress of a file, moving from 0% to 100% as the upload progresses.

```js
const Progress = React.forwardRef(({ className, value, ...props }, ref) => (
    <div
        ref={ref}
        className={`relative h-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-full bg-gray-200 ${className}`}
        {...props}
    >
        <div
            className="h-full w-full flex-1 bg-blue-500 transition-all"
            style={{ transform: `translateX(-${100 - (value || 0)}%)` }}
        />
    </div>
));
```

### 3. **Image Upload Component**
Main component that handles the drag-and-drop functionality, file preview, and the entire upload process with error handling and progress tracking.

#### Approach:
- Files are dragged or selected.
- The **`onDrop`** method captures the dropped files, generates previews, and initializes their upload status.
- **`simulateFileUpload`** mocks the upload process, updating the progress bar every 500ms until the upload is complete or an error occurs.
- The **removeFile** function allows removing a file from the upload list, whether uploaded or not.

```js
const ImageUpload = () => {
    const [files, setFiles] = useState([]);
    const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);

    const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles) => {
        setFiles((prevFiles) => [
            ...prevFiles,
            ...acceptedFiles.map((file) =>
                Object.assign(file, {
                    preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
                    progress: 0,
                    status: 'queued',
                    name: file.name,
                    size: file.size,
                })
            ),
        ]);
        setError(null);
    }, []);
```

### 4. **Simulated File Upload**
A helper function that simulates the upload process by updating the progress of each file in increments of 10% over time.

```js
const simulateFileUpload = (file, progressCallback) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let progress = 0;
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            progress += 10;
            progressCallback(progress);
            if (progress >= 100) {
                clearInterval(interval);
                if (Math.random() < 0.9) {
                    resolve();
                } else {
                    reject(new Error('Random upload error'));
                }
            }
        }, 500);
    });
};
```

## üìä Application Flow

```mermaid
graph TD;
  User-->Dropzone[Drag/Drop Image]
  Dropzone-->Preview[Preview Image]
  Dropzone-->UploadFiles
  UploadFiles-->Progress[Show Progress]
  Progress-->Success[Upload Success]
  Progress-->Error[Handle Errors]
```

1. User drops an image into the dropzone.
2. The image is previewed immediately.
3. Upload is triggered, and the progress bar starts updating.
4. Upon successful upload, a success icon is displayed.
5. In case of an error, the progress stops and an error message is shown.

## üìê Design and UI

The interface is designed using **Tailwind CSS** to provide a clean, responsive layout with minimalistic design patterns.

### Layout Preview:

```
+----------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------+
```

## üß© Future Improvements

- **Multiple Upload Options**: Add support for other file types like documents, PDFs, etc.
- **Real API Integration**: Replace the simulated upload with actual API integration.
- **Chunked Upload**: For large files, implement chunked uploads to ensure reliability.
- **File Validation**: Add more detailed file validation (e.g., file types, size limits).
