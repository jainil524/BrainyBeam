This project is a **React-based** image upload application that provides a user-friendly interface for dragging and dropping multiple images, tracking upload progress, and showing notifications for successful or failed uploads.

- **File Preview**: Displays thumbnails of the images before uploading.
- **Progress Bar**: Tracks the upload progress of each file.
- **Alerts**: Displays error or success messages during the upload process.
- **File Size Formatting**: Dynamically formats and displays file size (in Bytes, KB, MB, etc.).
- **File Removal**: Allows users to remove files from the upload list before or after upload.
- **Simulated Upload Process**: Uses a simulated upload function to mock the file upload process.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based library for building the user interface.
- **React Dropzone**: Handles drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Lucide Icons**: Used for icons (upload, delete, success, and error).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the components and layout.
