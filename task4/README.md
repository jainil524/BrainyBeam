## ⚙️ Component Overview

### 1. **Shared Input Component**
The primary component for rendering input fields. Supports multiple types and includes validation.

#### Approach:
- Handles text, email, password, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.
- Error messages are displayed dynamically based on the Yup validation schema.
- Inputs are rendered based on props, making the component reusable across various forms.

## 📊 Application Flow

```mermaid
graph TD;
  User-->InputField[Enter Data]
  InputField-->FormikState[Update Formik State]
  FormikState-->YupValidation[Perform Yup Validation]
  YupValidation-->ErrorHandling[Check for Errors]
  ErrorHandling-->Success[Submit Data]
```

1. User enters data in the input fields.
2. The form state is managed by Formik.
3. Yup validates the data based on predefined rules.
4. Errors are displayed if any field is invalid; otherwise, the form is submitted.
